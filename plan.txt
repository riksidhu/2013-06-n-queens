1)Make a new matrix

2)(toggle on) first queen first row at index 0 (do test)

3)(toggle on) 2nd queen in the row + 1 at index 0 - (do test)
  3a) Test for collisions is true
    3aa)(toggle off) current row value, then increment row index by one (toggle on)(do test)
  3b) Test for collisions is false (take current location and toggle on, proceed to next step
4)(toggle on) 3rd queen in the row + 1 at index 0 - (do test)
  4a)Test for collisions is true.
    4aa)(toggle off) current row value, then increment row index by one (toggle on)(do test)
  4b) Test for collisions is false



If collisions returns true for each index in current row go to parent and (toggle off) current index, then increment that index by 1 (do test)

If solution is found save the configuration

If the first row queen increments to index plus one, end
